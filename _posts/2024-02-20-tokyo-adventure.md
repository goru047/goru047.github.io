Tokyo is a city of contrasts. In one moment, you're standing in a 1,000-year-old temple, and the next, you're surrounded by neon lights and cutting-edge technology. This dichotomy makes Tokyo one of the most fascinating cities I've ever visited.

## Getting Around

Tokyo's public transportation system is incredibly efficient. I bought a 7-day JR Pass and used it extensively. The trains are always on time, clean, and easy to navigate even with limited Japanese language skills.

**Pro tip:** Download the Google Maps app and the Hyperdia app for real-time train schedules.

## Day 1: Asakusa and Traditional Tokyo

I started my trip in Asakusa, home to the famous Senso-ji Temple. Walking through the Kaminarimon (Thunder Gate) and down Nakamise Shopping Street felt like stepping back in time.

The temple complex was beautiful, with traditional architecture and the smell of incense filling the air. I tried omikuji (fortune telling) and got a "great blessing" prediction!

## Shibuya: The Heart of Modern Tokyo

Shibuya Crossing is just as chaotic and mesmerizing as you'd imagine. I watched from the Starbucks overlooking the crossing and saw hundreds of people cross in perfect harmony every few minutes.

The surrounding area is a shopping paradise with:

- Multiple department stores
- Trendy fashion boutiques
- Countless restaurants and cafes
- The famous Hachiko statue

## Food Adventures

Tokyo has more Michelin-starred restaurants than any other city in the world, but you don't need to spend a fortune for incredible food.

**Must-try dishes:**

1. **Sushi** at Tsukiji Outer Market
2. **Ramen** - I tried 6 different shops, each unique
3. **Tonkatsu** (breaded pork cutlet)
4. **Yakitori** at an izakaya
5. **Matcha everything** - ice cream, lattes, Kit-Kats

The convenience store food (7-Eleven, FamilyMart) is surprisingly good and cheap!

## Tokyo Skytree

At 634 meters tall, Tokyo Skytree offers breathtaking views of the entire city. On a clear day, you can see Mount Fuji in the distance. I went at sunset to see the city transition from day to night.

## Unique Experiences

### Robot Restaurant

Over-the-top, bizarre, and uniquely Japanese. It's expensive but an experience you won't find anywhere else.

### TeamLab Borderless

An immersive digital art museum that's absolutely mind-blowing. Rooms filled with projections that respond to your movements.

### Late-night Karaoke

Singing terrible pop songs with new friends at 3 AM is a Tokyo rite of passage.

## Cultural Observations

- **Cleanliness**: The city is spotless despite few public trash cans
- **Quiet**: People rarely talk on trains or phones in public
- **Service**: Customer service is exceptional everywhere
- **Safety**: I felt completely safe walking around at any hour

## Practical Tips

1. **Cash is king**: Many places don't accept cards
2. **Get a pocket WiFi**: Essential for navigation
3. **Learn basic Japanese phrases**: People appreciate the effort
4. **Shoes off**: Remember to remove shoes when entering homes or some restaurants
5. **Tipping**: Don't tipâ€”it can be considered rude

## Day Trips

I took the Shinkansen (bullet train) to:

- **Nikko**: Beautiful shrines and nature
- **Hakone**: Hot springs and views of Mt. Fuji

## Cost Breakdown

- Accommodation: $60-80/night (hostel)
- Food: $30-40/day
- Transportation: JR Pass $280 (7 days)
- Activities: $20-30/day
- **Total**: About $120-150/day

## Final Thoughts

Tokyo exceeded all expectations. It's clean, safe, efficient, and endlessly fascinating. The perfect blend of ancient tradition and futuristic innovation.

I spent 10 days and still feel like I barely scratched the surface. Already planning my return to explore more neighborhoods and experience different seasons (cherry blossom season is calling my name!).

**Best time to visit:**

- Spring (March-May): Cherry blossoms
- Fall (September-November): Pleasant weather, fall colors
- Avoid: July-August (hot and humid)

Would you visit Tokyo? What would be your first stop?
