## The Journey Begins

What started as a dream turned into the adventure of a lifetime. Three countries, three incredible cities, and countless unforgettable moments.

### Week 1: Paris - The City of Light

Paris greeted us with open arms and perfect spring weather. We spent three days exploring the iconic landmarks, hidden cafés, and charming neighborhoods.

**Highlights:**

- Morning croissants at a local boulangerie
- Sunset from the Eiffel Tower
- Getting lost in the Louvre's endless galleries
- Evening strolls along the Seine

### Week 2: Rome - The Eternal City

From Paris, we took a morning flight to Rome. The transition from French elegance to Italian passion was immediate and exhilarating.

**Highlights:**

- Standing inside the Colosseum at sunrise
- Tossing coins into the Trevi Fountain
- The best carbonara of my life in Trastevere
- Vatican Museums (arrived early to beat the crowds!)

### Week 3: Barcelona - Where Art Meets Beach

Our final stop was Barcelona, and what a perfect ending it was. Gaudí's architecture, Mediterranean beaches, and tapas galore.

**Highlights:**

- Sagrada Familia left us speechless
- Park Güell's colorful mosaics
- Fresh seafood at La Boqueria market
- Sunset at Barceloneta Beach

## Travel Tips

**Getting Around:**

- Paris to Rome: Flight (2 hours) - €80
- Rome to Barcelona: Train (overnight) - €120
- Within cities: Metro passes are your best friend

**Budget:**

- Accommodation: €60-100/night (mix of hostels and mid-range hotels)
- Food: €30-50/day per person
- Attractions: €15-30 per major site

**Best Time to Visit:**

- Spring (April-May) or Fall (September-October)
- Avoid August in Rome - it's scorching!

## Final Thoughts

Ten days, three cities, one incredible journey. Each city had its own personality, its own magic. Paris was elegant and romantic, Rome was historic and passionate, Barcelona was artistic and vibrant.

Would I do it again? In a heartbeat. Would I change anything? Maybe add a few more days in each city - there's always more to explore!

**Pro tip:** Don't try to see everything. Pick a few must-sees in each city, then leave room to wander and discover. Some of our best memories came from unplanned moments.
