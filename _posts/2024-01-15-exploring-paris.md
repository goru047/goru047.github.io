Paris has always been on my bucket list, and finally experiencing it in person exceeded all my expectations. The city truly lives up to its reputation as one of the most beautiful places in the world.

## Day 1: Arrival and First Impressions

Landing at Charles de Gaulle Airport, I took the RER train into the city center. The moment I stepped out of the metro station and saw my first glimpse of Haussmann architecture, I knew I was in for something special.

My hotel was in the Marais district, a charming neighborhood filled with narrow cobblestone streets, vintage boutiques, and some of the best falafel spots in the city.

## The Eiffel Tower

No trip to Paris is complete without visiting the Eiffel Tower. I went at sunset, and watching the tower light up as the sky turned purple and orange was absolutely breathtaking. The twinkling lights that come on every hour are even more magical in person than in photos.

**Tips:**

- Book tickets online in advance to skip the lines
- Visit at sunset for the best lighting
- The view from Trocadéro is perfect for photos

## Louvre Museum

I spent an entire day at the Louvre and still only saw a fraction of the collection. The Mona Lisa was smaller than I expected but still impressive. My favorite sections were:

1. Ancient Egyptian artifacts
2. Italian Renaissance paintings
3. Greek and Roman sculptures

The museum itself is a work of art, especially the glass pyramid entrance designed by I.M. Pei.

## Hidden Gems

Beyond the famous landmarks, I discovered some wonderful hidden spots:

- **Sainte-Chapelle**: A Gothic chapel with stunning stained glass windows
- **Canal Saint-Martin**: Perfect for a picnic with locals
- **Rue Cler Market**: An authentic Parisian market street

## Food Highlights

The food in Paris deserves its own post! Some highlights:

- Fresh croissants from a local boulangerie every morning
- Escargot at a traditional bistro
- Wine and cheese by the Seine
- The best crème brûlée of my life

## Final Thoughts

Paris is a city that rewards slow exploration. Take time to sit at cafés, watch people, and soak in the atmosphere. It's not just about checking off landmarks—it's about experiencing the French art de vivre (art of living).

I'm already planning my return trip to explore more neighborhoods and museums I missed this time.

**Travel Stats:**

- Duration: 5 days
- Budget: $150-200/day
- Best time to visit: Spring (April-May) or Fall (September-October)
- Transportation: Metro and walking
