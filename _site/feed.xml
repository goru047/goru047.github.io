<p>What started as a dream turned into the adventure of a lifetime. Three countries, three incredible cities, and countless unforgettable moments.</p>

<h3 id="week-1-paris---the-city-of-light">Week 1: Paris - The City of Light</h3>

<p>Paris greeted us with open arms and perfect spring weather. We spent three days exploring the iconic landmarks, hidden cafés, and charming neighborhoods.</p>

<p><strong>Highlights:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Morning croissants at a local boulangerie</li>
  <li>Sunset from the Eiffel Tower</li>
  <li>Getting lost in the Louvre’s endless galleries</li>
  <li>Evening strolls along the Seine</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="week-2-rome---the-eternal-city">Week 2: Rome - The Eternal City</h3>

<p>From Paris, we took a morning flight to Rome. The transition from French elegance to Italian passion was immediate and exhilarating.</p>

<p><strong>Highlights:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Standing inside the Colosseum at sunrise</li>
  <li>Tossing coins into the Trevi Fountain</li>
  <li>The best carbonara of my life in Trastevere</li>
  <li>Vatican Museums (arrived early to beat the crowds!)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="week-3-barcelona---where-art-meets-beach">Week 3: Barcelona - Where Art Meets Beach</h3>

<p>Our final stop was Barcelona, and what a perfect ending it was. Gaudí’s architecture, Mediterranean beaches, and tapas galore.</p>

<p><strong>Highlights:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Sagrada Familia left us speechless</li>
  <li>Park Güell’s colorful mosaics</li>
  <li>Fresh seafood at La Boqueria market</li>
  <li>Sunset at Barceloneta Beach</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="travel-tips">Travel Tips</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Paris to Rome: Flight (2 hours) - €80</li>
  <li>Rome to Barcelona: Train (overnight) - €120</li>
  <li>Within cities: Metro passes are your best friend</li>
</ul>

</ul>

<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>Ten days, three cities, one incredible journey. Each city had its own personality, its own magic. Paris was elegant and romantic, Rome was historic and passionate, Barcelona was artistic and vibrant.</p>

<p>Would I do it again? In a heartbeat. Would I change anything? Maybe add a few more days in each city - there’s always more to explore!</p>

<p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> Don’t try to see everything. Pick a few must-sees in each city, then leave room to wander and discover. Some of our best memories came from unplanned moments.</p>

From the moment I arrived, I fell in love with this Mediterranean city’s perfect blend of beach culture, Gothic architecture, modernist art, and incredible food.</p>

<h2 id="gaudís-barcelona">Gaudí’s Barcelona</h2>

<p>You can’t talk about Barcelona without talking about Antoni Gaudí. His whimsical, organic architecture defines the city.</p>

<h3 id="sagrada-familia">Sagrada Familia</h3>

<p>This was THE moment. Walking up to the Sagrada Familia for the first time, I was awestruck. Photos don’t do it justice. The basilica has been under construction since 1882 and still isn’t finished (estimated completion: 2026).</p>

<p>Inside is even more spectacular—the stained glass windows create a kaleidoscope of colors that changes throughout the day. I spent 3 hours here and could have stayed longer.</p>

<p><strong>Essential tips:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Book tickets online months in advance</li>
  <li>Visit at 9 AM or 3 PM when sunlight hits the stained glass perfectly</li>
  <li>Get the tower access for incredible views</li>
  <li>Audio guide is worth it</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="park-güell">Park Güell</h3>

<p>Gaudí’s colorful park feels like a fairy tale. The mosaic lizard (El Drac) at the entrance is iconic, but the real magic is in wandering the winding paths and sitting on the mosaic bench overlooking the city.</p>

<p>Go early (8 AM) to avoid crowds and enjoy peaceful morning light.</p>

<h3 id="casa-batlló-and-casa-milà">Casa Batlló and Casa Milà</h3>

<p>Both are stunning examples of Gaudí’s residential architecture. Casa Batlló’s facade looks like it’s made of bones and skulls—beautiful in a creepy way. Casa Milà (La Pedrera) has an incredible rooftop with warrior-like chimneys.</p>

<h2 id="gothic-quarter-barri-gòtic">Gothic Quarter (Barri Gòtic)</h2>

<p>Getting lost in the Gothic Quarter’s narrow medieval streets is the best way to experience old Barcelona. Every corner reveals:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Hidden plazas</li>
  <li>Ancient Roman walls</li>
  <li>Gothic churches</li>
  <li>Charming cafes</li>
</ul>

<p>The Barcelona Cathedral is stunning, and you can walk on the roof for panoramic views.</p>

<h2 id="la-rambla-and-boqueria-market">La Rambla and Boqueria Market</h2>

<p>La Rambla is the famous pedestrian boulevard running through the heart of Barcelona. It’s touristy but still worth experiencing.</p>

<p><strong>La Boqueria Market</strong> is a food lover’s paradise:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Fresh fruit stands with colorful displays</li>
  <li>Jamón ibérico counters</li>
  <li>Seafood stalls</li>
  <li>Fresh juice bars</li>
  <li>Tapas counters</li>
</ul>

<p>I had fresh oysters and a glass of cava for breakfast—peak Barcelona living.</p>

<h2 id="beach-life">Beach Life</h2>

<p>Barcelona has 4.5 km of beaches right in the city. I spent several afternoons at Barceloneta Beach:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Swimming in the Mediterranean</li>
  <li>People-watching</li>
  <li>Sipping sangria at beach bars</li>
  <li>Volleyball games</li>
</ul>

<p>The beach culture is real here. Locals actually use these beaches!</p>

<h2 id="food--drink">Food &amp; Drink</h2>

<p>Barcelona’s food scene is incredible. From Michelin-starred restaurants to hole-in-the-wall tapas bars, every meal was amazing.</p>

<h3 id="tapas-culture">Tapas Culture</h3>

<p>Forget dinner at 6 PM. In Barcelona, you eat tapas at 10 PM and dinner at midnight. When in Rome (or Barcelona)!</p>

<p><strong>Must-try tapas:</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Patatas bravas</strong> - Fried potatoes with spicy sauce</li>
  <li><strong>Pan con tomate</strong> - Tomato bread (simple but perfect)</li>
  <li><strong>Jamón ibérico</strong> - Cured ham (expensive but worth it)</li>
  <li><strong>Gambas al ajillo</strong> - Garlic shrimp</li>
  <li><strong>Pulpo a la gallega</strong> - Galician-style octopus</li>
  <li><strong>Croquetas</strong> - Creamy fried balls of heaven</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="vermouth-hour">Vermouth Hour</h3>

<p>I discovered vermouth hour (around 1-3 PM on Sundays). Locals gather at bars for vermouth on tap, olives, and potato chips. It’s a whole vibe.</p>

<h3 id="paella">Paella</h3>

<p>Traditional Valencian paella isn’t from Barcelona, but I had incredible seafood paella at a beachfront restaurant. The crispy socarrat (crusty bottom layer) was perfection.</p>

<h2 id="montjuïc">Montjuïc</h2>

<p>This hill overlooks the city and is packed with attractions:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Magic Fountain</strong>: Free light and music show</li>
  <li><strong>Montjuïc Castle</strong>: Historic fortress with great views</li>
  <li><strong>Olympic Stadium</strong>: From 1992 Olympics</li>
  <li><strong>Joan Miró Foundation</strong>: Modern art museum</li>
</ul>

<p>Take the cable car for amazing views during the ride.</p>

<h2 id="nightlife">Nightlife</h2>

<p>Barcelona’s nightlife is legendary:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Beach clubs in summer</li>
  <li>Gothic Quarter bars</li>
  <li>Clubs that open at 2 AM and close at 6 AM</li>
  <li>Live flamenco shows</li>
</ul>

<p>I’m not a huge party person, but even I got caught up in the energy.</p>

<h2 id="day-trips">Day Trips</h2>

<h3 id="montserrat">Montserrat</h3>

<p>An hour by train, this mountain monastery offers:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Stunning mountain views</li>
  <li>Medieval monastery</li>
  <li>Black Madonna statue</li>
  <li>Hiking trails</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="sitges">Sitges</h3>

<p>Charming beach town 30 minutes away</p>

<ul>
  <li>Beautiful beaches</li>
  <li>Quaint old town</li>
  <li>More relaxed vibe than Barcelona</li>
</ul>

  <li>The moment I first saw Sagrada Familia</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>Barcelona is that perfect combination of beach and city, history and modernity, relaxation and energy. It’s artsy without being pretentious, beachy without being boring, and cultural without being stuffy.</p>

<p>I came for 5 days and left wishing I had booked 10. This is a city where you can spend months and still discover new neighborhoods, new restaurants, new hidden corners.</p>

<p><strong>Duration recommendation:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Minimum: 3-4 days</li>
  <li>Ideal: 5-7 days</li>
  <li>With day trips: 10-14 days</li>
</ul>

<p>Barcelona is now in my top 3 favorite cities in the world. I’ll definitely be back.</p>

The Big Apple. The City That Never Sleeps. Whatever you call it, NYC is a place that demands to be experienced. Having spent a week exploring all five boroughs, I can confidently say it lives up to the hype.</p>

<h2 id="first-impressions">First Impressions</h2>

<p>Landing at JFK and taking a taxi into Manhattan, the skyline slowly coming into view—that’s a moment I’ll never forget. The energy hit me immediately. People everywhere, moving with purpose, the sound of car horns, the smell of street food. This is NYC.</p>

<h2 id="manhattan-the-heart-of-it-all">Manhattan: The Heart of It All</h2>

<h3 id="times-square">Times Square</h3>

<p>Yes, it’s touristy. Yes, it’s crowded. But experiencing Times Square at night is something everyone should do once. The sheer scale of the digital billboards and the mass of humanity is overwhelming in the best way.</p>

<h3 id="central-park">Central Park</h3>

<p>An oasis in the middle of Manhattan. I spent an entire afternoon here:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Rowboating on the lake</li>
  <li>Visiting Bethesda Fountain</li>
  <li>People-watching near Sheep Meadow</li>
  <li>Grabbing a pretzel from a street vendor</li>
</ul>

<p>The contrast between the park’s tranquility and the city surrounding it is remarkable.</p>

<h3 id="museum-mile">Museum Mile</h3>

<p>I visited three museums in two days:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Metropolitan Museum of Art</strong> - Could spend weeks here</li>
  <li><strong>Museum of Modern Art (MoMA)</strong> - Amazing modern art collection</li>
  <li><strong>American Museum of Natural History</strong> - The dinosaur halls are incredible</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="iconic-landmarks">Iconic Landmarks</h2>

<h3 id="statue-of-liberty">Statue of Liberty</h3>

<p>Taking the ferry to Liberty Island was a highlight. The statue is smaller than I imagined but still incredibly moving. Ellis Island’s immigration museum is a must-visit.</p>

<p><strong>Tips:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Book tickets weeks in advance</li>
  <li>Go early to avoid crowds</li>
  <li>Combine with Ellis Island visit</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="empire-state-building">Empire State Building</h3>

<p>I did both the Top of the Rock and Empire State Building. Controversial opinion: Top of the Rock has better views because you can actually see the Empire State Building in your photos!</p>

<h3 id="brooklyn-bridge">Brooklyn Bridge</h3>

<p>Walking across at sunset was magical. The views of Manhattan’s skyline are unbeatable. Arrived in Brooklyn just in time for dinner in DUMBO.</p>

<h2 id="food-scene">Food Scene</h2>

<p>NYC’s food scene is unparalleled. The diversity is insane.</p>

<p><strong>Can’t-miss foods:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>New York Pizza</strong>: Classic cheese slice from Joe’s Pizza</li>
  <li><strong>Bagels</strong>: H&amp;H Bagels with lox and cream cheese</li>
  <li><strong>Halal cart food</strong>: Chicken and rice from 53rd &amp; 6th</li>
  <li><strong>Cheesecake</strong>: Junior’s in Brooklyn</li>
  <li><strong>Hot dog</strong>: From a street cart (Nathan’s Famous)</li>
</ul>

<p>I also splurged on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Dim sum in Chinatown</li>
  <li>Italian food in Little Italy</li>
  <li>Tacos in the East Village</li>
  <li>Korean BBQ in K-Town</li>
</ul>

<p>Cobblestone streets, cast-iron buildings, high-end shopping, and art galleries. Perfect for an afternoon stroll.</p>

<h3 id="greenwich-village">Greenwich Village</h3>

<p>Charming, historic neighborhood with:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Washington Square Park</li>
  <li>Comedy clubs</li>
  <li>Jazz bars</li>
  <li>Cute cafes and restaurants</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="williamsburg-brooklyn">Williamsburg, Brooklyn</h3>

<p>The hipster capital. Great vintage shops, street art, rooftop bars, and craft breweries.</p>

<h3 id="harlem">Harlem</h3>

<p>Rich cultural history, soul food restaurants, and the famous Apollo Theater.</p>

<h2 id="broadway-show">Broadway Show</h2>

<p>Seeing a Broadway show is essential. I watched “Hamilton” and was blown away. The energy of a live Broadway performance is electric.</p>

<p><strong>Tips:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Book in advance for popular shows</li>
  <li>Check TKTS booth for day-of discounted tickets</li>
  <li>Matinee shows are often cheaper</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="getting-around">Getting Around</h2>

  <li><strong>Walking</strong>: Manhattan is very walkable</li>
  <li><strong>Uber/Taxi</strong>: For late nights or when you’re tired</li>
  <li><strong>CitiBike</strong>: Great for exploring at your own pace</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-pace-of-nyc">The Pace of NYC</h2>

<p>One thing that surprised me was how fast-paced everything is. New Yorkers walk fast, talk fast, and eat fast. I learned to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Never block the sidewalk</li>
  <li>Know your order before reaching the counter</li>
  <li>Stand right, walk left on escalators</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="hidden-gems">Hidden Gems</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>High Line</strong>: Elevated park built on old rail tracks</li>
  <li><strong>Smorgasburg</strong>: Weekend food market in Brooklyn</li>
  <li><strong>Grand Central Terminal</strong>: Beautiful architecture, free to visit</li>

<ul>
  <li>Cocktails at speakeasies (PDT, Please Don’t Tell)</li>
  <li>Jazz clubs in Greenwich Village</li>
  <li>Rooftop bars with skyline views</li>
  <li>Late-night comedy shows</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="budget-tips">Budget Tips</h2>

  <li>Transportation: $33 (unlimited MetroCard)</li>
  <li>Activities: $30-50</li>
  <li><strong>Total</strong>: $180-290/day</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="weather-note">Weather Note</h2>

<p>I visited in March, and it was chilly! Bring layers. Summer (June-August) is hot and humid. Fall is considered the best time to visit.</p>

<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>A week wasn’t enough. NYC is a city where you could spend months and still discover new things. Every neighborhood has its own personality, every street has a story.</p>

<p>Is it expensive? Yes. Is it crowded? Absolutely. Is it worth it? 100%.</p>

<p>The diversity, the culture, the food, the energy—there’s truly no place like New York City. I left exhausted but already planning my return.</p>

<p><strong>Recommended Duration:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>First visit: 5-7 days</li>
  <li>To really explore: 2 weeks</li>
  <li>To scratch the surface: 3-4 days minimum</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="my-top-5-nyc-experiences">My Top 5 NYC Experiences</h2>

In one moment, you’re standing in a 1,000-year-old temple, and the next, you’re surrounded by neon lights and cutting-edge technology. This dichotomy makes Tokyo one of the most fascinating cities I’ve ever visited.</p>

<h2 id="getting-around">Getting Around</h2>

<p>Tokyo’s public transportation system is incredibly efficient. I bought a 7-day JR Pass and used it extensively. The trains are always on time, clean, and easy to navigate even with limited Japanese language skills.</p>

<p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> Download the Google Maps app and the Hyperdia app for real-time train schedules.</p>

<h2 id="day-1-asakusa-and-traditional-tokyo">Day 1: Asakusa and Traditional Tokyo</h2>

<p>I started my trip in Asakusa, home to the famous Senso-ji Temple. Walking through the Kaminarimon (Thunder Gate) and down Nakamise Shopping Street felt like stepping back in time.</p>

<p>The temple complex was beautiful, with traditional architecture and the smell of incense filling the air. I tried omikuji (fortune telling) and got a “great blessing” prediction!</p>

<h2 id="shibuya-the-heart-of-modern-tokyo">Shibuya: The Heart of Modern Tokyo</h2>

<p>Shibuya Crossing is just as chaotic and mesmerizing as you’d imagine. I watched from the Starbucks overlooking the crossing and saw hundreds of people cross in perfect harmony every few minutes.</p>

<p>The surrounding area is a shopping paradise with:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Multiple department stores</li>

<p><strong>Must-try dishes:</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Sushi</strong> at Tsukiji Outer Market</li>

The city truly lives up to its reputation as one of the most beautiful places in the world.</p>

<h2 id="day-1-arrival-and-first-impressions">Day 1: Arrival and First Impressions</h2>

<p>Landing at Charles de Gaulle Airport, I took the RER train into the city center. The moment I stepped out of the metro station and saw my first glimpse of Haussmann architecture, I knew I was in for something special.</p>

<p>My hotel was in the Marais district, a charming neighborhood filled with narrow cobblestone streets, vintage boutiques, and some of the best falafel spots in the city.</p>

<h2 id="the-eiffel-tower">The Eiffel Tower</h2>

<p>No trip to Paris is complete without visiting the Eiffel Tower. I went at sunset, and watching the tower light up as the sky turned purple and orange was absolutely breathtaking. The twinkling lights that come on every hour are even more magical in person than in photos.</p>

<p><strong>Tips:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Book tickets online in advance to skip the lines</li>
  <li>Visit at sunset for the best lighting</li>
  <li>The view from Trocadéro is perfect for photos</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="louvre-museum">Louvre Museum</h2>

<p>I spent an entire day at the Louvre and still only saw a fraction of the collection. The Mona Lisa was smaller than I expected but still impressive. My favorite sections were:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Ancient Egyptian artifacts</li>
  <li>Italian Renaissance paintings</li>
  <li>Greek and Roman sculptures</li>
</ol>

<p>The museum itself is a work of art, especially the glass pyramid entrance designed by I.M. Pei.</p>

<h2 id="hidden-gems">Hidden Gems</h2>

<p>Beyond the famous landmarks, I discovered some wonderful hidden spots:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Sainte-Chapelle</strong>: A Gothic chapel with stunning stained glass windows</li>
  <li><strong>Canal Saint-Martin</strong>: Perfect for a picnic with locals</li>
  <li><strong>Rue Cler Market</strong>: An authentic Parisian market street</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="food-highlights">Food Highlights</h2>

<p>The food in Paris deserves its own post! Some highlights:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Fresh croissants from a local boulangerie every morning</li>
  <li>Escargot at a traditional bistro</li>
  <li>Wine and cheese by the Seine</li>
  <li>The best crème brûlée of my life</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>Paris is a city that rewards slow exploration. Take time to sit at cafés, watch people, and soak in the atmosphere. It’s not just about checking off landmarks—it’s about experiencing the French art de vivre (art of living).</p>

<p>I’m already planning my return trip to explore more neighborhoods and museums I missed this time.</p>

<p><strong>Travel Stats:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Duration: 5 days</li>
  <li>Budget: $150-200/day</li>
